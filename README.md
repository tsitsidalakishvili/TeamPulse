Scrum Team Pulse - Your Agile Project Dashboard

This web application helps Agile project teams manage their projects effectively. It's designed to be user-friendly for everyone, not just IT experts. Here's how it works:

Tab 1: Data

You can start by uploading your project data in the form of a CSV file.
Or, if you don't have data ready, you can use sample data or even connect to your Jira project management system to fetch real-time project data.

Tab 2: Column Selector

This tab allows you to select and organize the columns of your project data. You can rename columns to make them more understandable.

Tab 3: Chart Creation

Now, you can create insightful charts to visualize your project's progress. You have two options:
Use AI Assistance (LLM): You can ask questions about your data, and the app will generate charts for you.
Create Charts Yourself: If you know exactly what you want, you can select the data, choose the type of chart (like bar, line, or pie), and customize it.

Tab 4: Dashboard

This is where you can view and organize all the charts you've created. It's like your project's dashboard, displaying key information at a glance.

Tabs 5 and 6: Templates (Optional)

These tabs offer pre-designed charts and insights to help you assess individual and team performance more efficiently.
So, whether you're managing a software development project or any other kind of project using Agile methodologies, this application simplifies data handling and visualization, making it easier for your team to stay on track and make informed decisions. Enjoy using it to boost your project's success!
